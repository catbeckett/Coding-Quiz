# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Overview

This coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. In this weekâ€™s challenge we built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser, and features updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code which deploys clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
