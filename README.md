# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Overview

This coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. In this weekâ€™s challenge we built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. 

This app runs in the browser, and features updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code which deploys clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## This code meets the acceptance Criteria as it includes:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.

  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears

  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz ends when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

* When the game ends, it displays the user's score and gives them the ability to save their initials and their score.
